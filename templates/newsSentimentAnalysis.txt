    ]
  }
}
```

## Processing Rules

1. **Validate content relevance**: Article must be related to stock trading
   - Non-relevant response: `{"error": "Not related to stock trading"}`

2. **Extract ticker symbol**: Identify the primary ticker discussed
   - If no ticker found: `{"error": "No ticker symbol found"}`

3. **Analyze sentiment**: Generate comprehensive trader sentiment analysis

## Sentiment Score Guidelines
- **-10**: Catastrophic news (bankruptcy, massive fraud) - expects 10%+ immediate drop
- **-5**: Major negative news (significant losses, failed merger) - expects 5-10% drop
- **0**: Neutral news - minimal price impact expected
- **+5**: Strong positive news (major contract win, earnings beat) - expects 5-10% rise
- **+10**: Groundbreaking news (revolutionary product, transformative acquisition) - expects 10%+ surge
